   returns # characters converted
   dest will only be '\0'-terminated if there is enough space. this is
   for consistency; imagine there are 2 bytes of space left, but the next
   character requires 3 bytes. in this case we could NUL-terminate, but in
   general we can't when there's insufficient space. therefore this function
   only NUL-terminates if all the characters fit, and there's space for
   the NUL as well.
   the destination string will never be bigger than the source string.
